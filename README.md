# IniTech-Asset-Management-Project
Graduate IT project developing an integrated IT Asset Management (ITAM) system with dashboards, security architecture, and process automation.
# IniTech Solutions – IT Asset Management Project

**Course:** IFT 550 – Enterprise Information Systems  
**Institution:** Arizona State University – The Polytechnic School  

## Project Overview:
This project presents the design and implementation of an **IT Asset Management (ITAM)** system for **IniTech Solutions**.  
The solution replaces decentralized Excel-based tracking with an automated, secure, and scalable web application.

## Problem Statement:
The previous ITAM process relied on unstandardized spreadsheets leading to:
- Data inconsistency and manual errors  
- Lack of validation and automation  
- No executive-level dashboards or forecasting tools  
- Difficulty in tracking asset lifecycles  


## Technology Solution
The new solution integrates:
- **Centralized asset tracking** via web dashboards  
- **Real-time monitoring** of assets and cost analytics  
- **Role-based access control** for secure authentication  
- **Process maps & GUI designs** for both Serialized Asset Tracker and Stockroom systems  

## Project Benefits:
- Reduced help desk interaction time by **50%**  
- Lowered cost per asset by **30% in the first year**  
- Estimated ROI: **653%**  
- Improved security, compliance, and scalability  


## System Components:
### 1. Serialized Asset Tracker
- Process map and GUI design  
- Secure login and role-based authentication  
- Data logging and audit tracking  

### 2. Stockroom:
- Asset lifecycle management interface  
- Integration with authentication workflows  
- Physical security through access controls  

### 3. Network Topology
- Demonstrates connectivity between SAT, Stockroom, and database services  
- Supports multi-user concurrent access and remote monitoring  


## Security Architecture
- Multi-layer login and authentication systems  
- Role-based permissions for administrators, staff, and technicians  
- Encryption and audit logs to prevent unauthorized access  

## Presentation
The detailed PowerPoint presentation is included:
> **File:** `Milestone 4 Final Presentation-1.pptx`  
> Contains system design, architecture diagrams, process maps, GUIs, and references.
